# React + Vite
An Employee Management System (EMS) built with ReactJS and Tailwind CSS is a modern, responsive, and efficient web application designed to manage employee data.
Tech Stack:

ReactJS:
The entire system is built using Reactâ€™s component-based architecture, making the UI highly modular and reusable.

JavaScript (ES6+):
For logic and dynamic behavior.

LocalStorage/SessionStorage (Optional):
Persist employee data locally without a backend.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
